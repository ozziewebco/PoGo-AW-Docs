# Trainer Setup

# Setting your team
When you first enter the Pokemon Go Albury Wodonga Discord server you will be presented with limited options until you have set your team.

To set your team make sure you are in the `#welcome` channel and type one of the following commands:
* Type `!team instinct` for Instinct.
* Type `!team mystic` for Mystic.
* Type `!team valor` for Valor.

## Choosing your region
We currently offer three raid regions in the Albury Wodonga Discord server. To join a region you need to go the the #profiles channel and type one of the following commands to toggle your membership to that region:
* `.go Albury`
* `.go Wodonga`
* `.go Lavington`
